## Answers for additional questions
- Yes, there is some repeated logic. We can improve it by using abstract classes. I made a simple example, but there are many ways to make it faster and better.

- For pagination, we can use a ResourceCollection. This will wrap the paginated data and automatically add pagination info, making it easy to work with.

- We would need translation APIs, but there could be limits or errors when translating a lot of posts and comments. This could slow down the system without caching or other optimizations.

- To create link previews, we need to send a request to the URL and pull data like the title, description, and thumbnail. Tools like Guzzle can help fetch this data for the response.

- Handling file attachments like images and videos can be challenging because of large file sizes, secure storage, and scaling the system for many uploads. AWS S3 can help with this by providing reliable, scalable, and secure storage.

- To track which users have seen posts, we can use a pivot table. Every time a user views a post, we add an entry to the table. To calculate the percentage of users who have seen the post, we divide the number of unique views by the total number of users and multiply by 100.<p align="center"><a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laravel/art/master/logo-lockup/5%20SVG/2%20CMYK/1%20Full%20Color/laravel-logolockup-cmyk-red.svg" width="400" alt="Laravel Logo"></a></p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
